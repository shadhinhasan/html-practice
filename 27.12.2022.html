			The point of using <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is that it has a more-or-<strong>less normal</strong> distribution of <i>letters</i>, as opposed to using '<em>Content here</em>, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop <mark>publishing packages</mark> and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (<small>injected humour and the like</small>).There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, <del>by injected humour</del>, or randomised words which don't look even <ins>slightly believable</ins>. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything <sub>embarrassing hidden</sub> in the middle of text.
